## Time

Monday 3rd period, 13:00pm - 14:30pm


## Course Description

Computer-generated images are everywhere in movies, video games, and VR. 
This course is an introduction to the techniques to animate objects in computer graphics based on the law of physics. 
The aim of the course is to get familiar with applied mathematics such as linear algebra, vector analysis, partial differential equations, variational principle, optimization, and numerical analysis through the animation techniques for particle systems, rigid bodies, elastic bodies. 
There are C++ programming assignments to acquire research-oriented graphics programming skills. 

Topics:
- affine transformation / homography
- character animation
- visualization
- optimization
- mesh deformation
- fluid simulation

## Grading

- 20% lecture attendance
  - Attendance is counted based on writing a secret keyword on LMS. The keyword is announced for each lecture.  
- 80% small assignemnts
  - see below

## Assignemnts

There are many small programming assignments. To do the assignments, you need to create your own copy of this repository through **GitHub Classroom**.  These assignements needs to be submitted using **pull request** functionality of the GitHub. Look at the following document. 

[How to Submit the Assignments](doc/submit.md)

### Policy

- Do the assignment by yourself. Don't share the assignments with others.
- Don't post the answers of the assignment on Slack 
- Late submission of an assignment is subject to grade deduction
- Score each assignemnt will not be open soon (instructer needs to adjust weight of the score later)

### Tasks

- [task0](task0): build C++ Program with CMake
- [task1](task1): Affine transformation
- [task2](task2): articulated rigid bone
- [task3](task3): ray casting 
- [task4](task4): rastering
- [task5](task5): navigation mesh
- [task6](task6): laplacian mesh deformation
- [task7](task7): inverse kinematics
- [task8](task8): as-rigid-as possible mesh deformation
